# The Project is back for 3.25 baby!
You can now Add a manual .csv file (example is available in the release files) and add/override anointments that are missing/wrong
Was able to semi automate the process of updating anointments by making it possible to extract the anointment data for amulets from the Path of building tree lua data.
Making it easier/faster if anointments get changed.
Changed the versioning of the tool to be in accordance to path of Exile's version numbers to make it easier to see if the tool is up to date.


# Godot-Path-of-Oil
Inspired by https://github.com/DrZed/Path-Of-Oil and using the icons. And the anointment csv files in a modified/cleaned up form.

## How to Use:

- Open tool
- Hover Item with Annoint
- Press Ctrl + C
- Tool now shows the Oils for the annoint

The tool works by reading your clipboard, for which you just need to have the tool open and hover over the item you want to check the annoints on and press CTRL + C.

Path of Exile will now copy the representative Item description into your clipboard which the tool will now react to and should display the oils, if the item is annointed and is a Ring or Amulet.
